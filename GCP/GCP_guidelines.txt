Hi All,                                       

After your selection for traveling on GCP to Germany, you currently must be in a phase of preparing for your new assignment and onsite role. 

You would have a lot of questions on the policy, and your entitlements. We have set up a conference call, to help you prepare for your assignment. Please note the pre-departure call is MANDATORY for the assignees scheduled to travel on GCP.

Kindly login to  https://gcphub.accenture.com>> GCP Destination>> Choose required country >> refer to required document under Information HUB

Note: 
1.    In case you have already attended the session and are receiving the invite as a repeat, please contact your GCP People Advisor.
2.    In case you are unable to attend the session, you shall receive the invite for the next available session till you have successfully attended the session.
3.    You would be required to share your attendance on the chat window at the end of the session failing to do so would lead to absenteeism.
